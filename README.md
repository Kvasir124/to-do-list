 ## Functionality

The site's function is to provide the user with a simple to-do list. The user can add tasks by filling out the input field and then pressing the "add task" button, which submits the simple form. This causes the task to appear in the list below with two buttons on either side - one for marking the task as done and the other for deleting it. Each submitted task has its own buttons, which the user can interact with independently.

## Responsiveness

With the use of CSS Media queries, the site adapts to small screens (<767px) by moving the "add task" button under the input field. This ensures that the input field doesn't shrink too much and obscure the written text.
